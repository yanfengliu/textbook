# Figure brief — the template a chapter copies

Copy everything below the rule into `biology/chNN-<slug>/FIGURES.md`, fill in the table and one block per figure, and leave the "What every figure here owes" section as it is. That section is the contract the figures are judged against, and it is in the brief rather than in a design doc so that a figure worker reads it before writing code instead of hearing it in a rejection.

Nothing has to be added to `tools/pages-exclude.txt` for it: `**/*.md` excludes every Markdown file in the tree, and `test/publish.test.js` asserts that a brief is excluded **by its shape, not by its name being on a list**. Chapters 2 and 3 were listed one at a time and shipped 45 KB of internal briefs before anyone noticed; chapter 4's would have been the next. If you find yourself wanting to name this file in that list, the pattern is what has to change.

The book's design is [textbook.md](textbook.md); the order a chapter is built in is [chapter-recipe.md](chapter-recipe.md). A figure worker needs this brief and nothing else: the standing records under `docs/learning/` are looked up through their indexes when something goes wrong, never read to start work.

# Chapter N — figure brief

Six to nine figures, in the order they appear in `index.html`. The figure number is fixed by that order and the prose cites every one of them by number, so the order does not change without editing the prose.

| # | Kind | Id | Section | WebGL | `aspect` | `narrowAspect` |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| N.1 | `kind` | `fig-kind` | opener, cited in N.1 | no | 16 / 9 | 4 / 5 |

Kind ids and figure ids are clear of every other chapter's. Check `src/figures/registry.js` before choosing.

## What every figure here owes

Nothing in this section is answered by a gate unless the line names one. The gates prove that a figure mounts, reports what it claims and survives being pressed; every judgement below is a person's, made at the artefact's own resolution, in both themes, at the widths a reader uses.

**A 2D figure is built on `src/figures/lib/bench.js`.** It is not a framework: it is a function called inside `mount` that returns the object the frame already expects. What that means for the block you write below is that four of the lines in this section stop being yours to remember and become the bench's to enforce — the readout cannot be a pill, a chip, a bordered box or a progress bar because `readout()` emits only `<text>` and `<line>`; the primary action is `primary: true` and the bench renders it as `--rule-head` on the edge and the ink's weight, never as a fill; a control's narrow label is a second span and its accessible name is the long label at every width, by construction; and a negative or `NaN` dimension throws in the lab instead of reaching the DOM, because `pane.rect` and its siblings are the only way to a dimension attribute. `test/bench.test.js` fails a bench figure that defines `mulberry32`, makes its own `ResizeObserver`, writes `border-radius` or `border:` in its own CSS, or calls `el('rect'|'circle'|'line'|'ellipse')` directly.

Everything else in this section is still yours, and the honest list of what the bench does **not** reach is in [figure-bench.md](figure-bench.md): whether a composition is *good*, whether a label collides at one slider value and not another, whether an assembled sentence is grammatical in every state, and whether the type is legible at 390 px. The bench is finished before the chapter's figure workers start and none of them may extend it — if it cannot do something, drop through to `pane.add()` for that one thing and propose the extension for the next chapter. The six WebGL figures keep `lib/three-common.js` for the scene and take only the chrome; the 資治通鑑 figures take nothing, because the bench's text fitting is an advance estimate measured on Inter over mixed-case Latin.

### It is a mechanism

It shows a mechanism the reader changes, not a picture of a noun. A labelled diagram that could have been a static image is a weak figure. Prefer, in rough order: a simulation the reader perturbs, a 3D thing they turn over, a scrubbable sequence, an authored illustration that responds. Each block below says in one line why its figure is a mechanism; if that line is hard to write, the figure is the problem.

### Composition

- **A panel that is half empty is a composition failure, and the fix is to re-compose — never to add filler.** Change the aspect, move the readout, let the drawing fill the pane. `polymer` held two 30 px hexagons in a dead lower-left quadrant and `secretion` was half empty from default paragraph margins; both passed every gate first.
- The drawing is the figure. Controls and readouts serve it and do not compete with it for area.
- Nothing is sized by a browser default. A margin, a size or a gap that exists because nothing set it is a decision not yet made.

### Readouts

- **A readout is a typographic table, not application chrome.** No pills, no chips, no bordered boxes, no rounded rectangles, no progress bar with its caption over the fill, no letter circles, no translucent panels behind text.
- Set it the way the book sets a table: a label in the interface face, the number in tabular figures, a hairline between rows only if rows need separating, and space where a box would have gone.
- **The figure stage is the only drawn rectangle in the book.** Inside it the rule still holds. If a control genuinely must declare its own extent, the sorting activity's single square hairline is the pattern.
- A readout's sentence is read by a person in every state its parts can take. `secretion` stage 7 read "In the outside the cell."
- A readout says what the figure is doing now. `prokaryote` described an intact wall in its envelope paragraph while the line above it said the wall was gone.

### Controls

- Control rows are grouped by what they do — what to show, what to change, what to run — with space between the groups and none inside one.
- **The primary action looks primary**, told by `--rule-head` on its edge and the ink's weight, never by a fill.
- Everything is reachable and operable by keyboard, and nothing depends on hover: a tap is a hover and a click in one gesture, and the hover gets there first (defect register, 2026-09-12).
- A control's narrow label is the same word as its wide label, because an item's goal quotes it. Four chapter-3 goals had to be reworded when `surface-volume`'s phone labels turned out to be "Villi", "Rod", "Disc" and "Clock".

### Labels

- **Every label is placed so that it cannot collide** — with another label, with the line or shape it names, with the toolbar, or with the edge of the stage. At every stage of a run, at every width, in both themes.
- A collision is a state, not a layout: it appears at one slider value and not another. `waterprops` collided at the chart origin, `plantcell3d`'s slider label wrapped and pushed the toolbar over the nucleus labels, `prokaryote` at 390 px overprinted three envelope labels, `cilium` at 390 px clipped its section chip and ran a card under the toolbar.
- A label drawn off the stage is not a label. `plantcell3d` labelled a channel 11 µm outside the frame.

### The narrow composition

- **A figure whose type would fall below about nine device pixels on a phone carries a second composition, not a scaled-down first one.** Nine device pixels is about three CSS pixels on a 3× phone; 7 CSS px is about 21 device px and passes.
- A figure that can fill any shape declares a `narrowAspect` in the registry. Say here what the narrow composition drops, stacks or re-orients.
- `npm run narrow` proves the narrow layout mounts, draws something that is not blank, flat or near-black, and survives a press. It says nothing about legibility, which is why it writes `out/narrow/` at three times scale.
- **Somebody looks at every figure at 390 px, at 3×, in both themes, before it is called done.** Five figures gained a second composition with no gate over any of that code, and chapter 2's eight were first looked at narrow days after they had been accepted at desktop width.

### Geometry

- **No negative and no `NaN` geometry, at any width.** A chapter-3 figure handed the DOM `<rect width="-0.1">` at tablet and desktop but not at phone; it reached main, was pushed, and logged console errors on the live site.
- Clamp every computed width, height, radius and length where it is computed. A `NaN` on an attribute the browser ignores fails silently, so guard the arithmetic rather than waiting for a console error.

### Colour, determinism and the contract — these the gates hold

- Colour comes from `ctx.palette` or the CSS variables, never a new hex (`test/palette.test.js`, and the one element and one organelle table in `test/element-table.test.js` and `test/organelle-table.test.js`).
- No `Math.random`: a seeded generator, so `setTime(t)` reproduces a frame exactly. `test/element-table.test.js` fails any `Math.random()` anywhere under `src/figures/`.
- The module contract — `meta`, `mount(root, ctx)` returning `destroy`, `setTime`, `describe`, `setVisible`, optional `setTheme`, and `setView` for 3D — is in [textbook.md](textbook.md) and held by `test/registry.test.js`, `npm run drive` and `npm run sweep3d`.
- Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the figure still works and nothing moves until the reader moves it.

### `describe()`

Three things read it: `npm run drive`, `npm run narrow`, and every `task` item in `items.js`. Write it for them.

- **It may not report `id`, `kind`, `number` or `state`.** The frame owns those four and spreads them last, so a figure using one would lose its own value without a word. `npm run drive` fails it. `foldlab` reports `foldState`; `plantcell3d` reports `turgorState`.
- Report the numbers in the units the prose uses, so a task's goal and the readout agree.
- Every field an item can name must be reachable through the reader's own controls, and **must not become true on its own as the clock runs** — otherwise the only load-bearing clause in the expectation is the one proving the reader acted.

### A figure's words are prose

A sentence inside a figure module is read by the same reader and is corrected when the chapter is. `symbiont.js` carried a claim about mitochondrial division machinery for days after the prose had dropped it as wrong.

---

## N.1 · `kind` — Title

**What it shows.** The drawing, what is on the stage, at what scale, and in what state it opens.

**What the reader does.** Every control, what it changes, and what the reader should be able to discover by using it.

**Objectives it teaches.** `objective-id`, `objective-id`.

**`describe()`**

| field | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `t` | number | clock, seconds |

**Why it is a mechanism.** One sentence: what the reader can falsify here that a static picture could only assert.

**Narrow composition.** What changes below 800 px, and what is dropped rather than shrunk.

## Notes for whoever registers these

- Which figures need a `narrowAspect`, and which carry a second composition.
- Which are WebGL, and so are `npm run sweep3d`'s; state each one's default view.
- Every kind needs a recipe in `tools/drive.js` or `npm run drive` fails, so write the recipes from this brief before the modules exist.
- Which figure to merge into which if one has to be cut, and what the chapter loses.
